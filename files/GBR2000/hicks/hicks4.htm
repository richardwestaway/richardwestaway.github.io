With   this, the original bed level data has been interpolated to a 1 m node-spacing,   square-grid DEM, which has been detrended by removing a planar surface fitted   by regression to the whole reach. Thus, the grey-scale of each pixel on the   image map indicates the local elevation at 1 m spacings. The local relief over   the whole study reach never exceeds 3 m, while the standard deviation of the   detrended elevation is approximately 0.4 m. </font></P><P ALIGN="center"><a name="fig5"></a><img src="FIG5.jpg" width="800" height="253" alt="Figure 5"></P><P ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Figure   5.</b> Image map of the detrended topography of the Waimakariri study reach   based on airborne laser survey and water-depth mapping. Each pixel represents   a 1 m spaced node on the digital elevation model and its grey-scale colour indicates   elevation. The grey-scale ranges from + 1.5 m elevation (white) to -1.5 m (black).   River flow is from left to right. The white 'spike' in the centre of the true   right bank (at the base of the image) is the Crossbank groyne.</font></P></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a broad scale, the riverbed shows   a narrower belt of active braiding that often (but not always) meanders around   broad, low relief alternate bars that are intricately dissected by dendritic   drainage networks. Field inspection and the video record show that the braid   belt remains actively braiding even at low flow, as the main flow tends to concentrate   into these channels. The broad location of the braid belt tends to be persistent,   at least during 'freshes' (i.e, small, common flood events). Inspection of past   aerial photographs suggests that it can switch as a result of large floods.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This broad pattern is not apparent   on aerial photographs nor on the concurrent map of water depth (<a href="#fig6">Figure   6</a>), where the eye tends to focus on the binary wet/dry pattern and the subtleties   of the large and fine-scale topography are lost. </font></p><p align="center"><a name="fig6"></a><img src="FIG6.jpg" width="800" height="198" alt="Figure 6"></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Figure 6.</b>   Water depths over the study reach mapped from aerial photographs using an empirical   relationship between water depth and colour (Westaway et al., <a href="../westaway/westawayf.htm">this   volume</a>). Water depth grades from 0 m (dark blue) to 1.2+ m (white). The   area covered is the same as that in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Flow direction   is left to right.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dendritic channel networks on   the alternate 'point bars' are clearly fractal in pattern and some develop to   fourth order. They show very little truncation by cross-cutting channels, which   suggests that they are reasonably persistent. However, we have observed headward   extension of some of the first order channels from a comparison of our February   1999 and May 2000 surveys. Thus we expect that ultimately the dendritic networks   will connect with the braiding network and the topography over the bars will   display a mixture of braiding and dendritic channels. The largest local relief   anywhere in the study reach is to be found in scour pools downstream of confluences   where third order channels join. These pools may be over 2 m deep, whereas channels   in the braided belt are rarely deeper than 1 m at normal flows. We suggest that   these dendritic networks are formed during bankfull and near-bankfull flows   when water without bed material spills over the upstream margins of the broad   bar features. We also hypothesise that the bars themselves are formed during   large floods, when the bankfull flows are confined to a quasi-straight path   by the bank vegetation and ultimately the stopbanks, and the water becomes deep   enough for an incipient alternate bar pattern to develop. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The relative relief of the broad-scale   alternate bar forms is of the order of only a few metres, while the wavelength   of the meander cycle through the study reach is estimated at 4900 m. For a channel   width of approximately 1000 m, this indicates a wavelength:width ratio of 4.9,   which is within the range of single row alternate bars described elsewhere in   the literature (e.g., Ikeda, 1984, Jaeggi, 1984). However, the width:depth ratio   at bankfull conditions, which is greater than 500, is much larger than expected   for single-row alternate bars, indeed for this width:depth ratio development   of the higher mode bars that lead to braiding is expected (Ikeda, 1984). Thus   there does not appear to be a clear explanation of the origin of this large-scale   morphology in the literature. Interestingly, an alternate-bar-wavelength to   channel-width ratio of approximately 5 is maintained for some 14 km downstream   from the study reach as the channel is progressively confined to a 350 m width   (<a href="hicks2.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Possibly, the influence of the higher   relief single-row alternate bar pattern in the confined reach extends upstream   into the braided reach. </font></p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <p>   <center>    <font color="#3366FF"> <a href="hicksf.htm"  ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks2.htm"  >Study reach</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks3.htm"  >Surveys     and methods</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks4.htm"  >Broad-scale     topography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks5.htm"  >Braid belt dynamics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks6.htm"  >Summary and Conclusions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks7.htm"  >References</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font>   </center></p></font></font> </BODY> </HTML>
