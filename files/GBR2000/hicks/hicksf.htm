Some   definitions of braiding simply require anabranches that divide and join, while   others (e.g., Ashmore, 1991) distinguish braiding channels, which actively maintain   an ever-changing but statistically similar pattern, from anastomosing channel   networks, which branch and join around islands but show temporal stability.   </font></P></font><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various studies   (e.g., Leopold and Wolman, 1957, Henderson, 1961) have shown that braided rivers   tend to occur within a particular 'existence space' defined by limited ranges   of water discharge (Q), valley slope (S), bed material size (D), and bank strength.   Typically, braided channels occur with abundant supplies of non-cohesive bed   material, adequate stream power (proportional to QS) to transport the bed material,   low-strength non-cohesive bed and bank material, and a geomorphic setting that   provides for sufficient lateral space for the braiding pattern to develop. A   key factor is the ready availability of recyclable bed material from braid banks.   Factors which increase bank strength, such as cohesive sediments and vegetation,   thwart this process, and the river flow tends to concentrate in a single channel   which either meanders or, with a steeper valley slope, forms a straight, alternate-bar   type channel. </font></P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The emphasis on   such classification systems of channel pattern has generally been to explain   why channel patterns vary spatially, from river to river or from reach to reach.   In this paper, we take a new view of a braided riverbed, based not on the pattern   of wetted channels but on the full three-dimensional topography of the entire   riverbed. By doing this we discover a pattern of channels that is more complex   than that suggested from aerial photographs but nonetheless may be explained   in terms of a superposition of morphologic features of different scales that   are formed at different levels of flood flow. We do this by examining, at high   spatial density and resolution, the topography of a braided reach of the lower   Waimakariri River near Christchurch, New Zealand. Also, we monitor the evolution   of morphologic features using time-lapse video imagery from cameras that provide   an oblique aerial view of the riverbed. </font></P><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><p> <center><font color="#3366FF">            <a href="hicksf.htm"  ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;             <a href="hicks2.htm"  >Study reach</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;             <a href="hicks3.htm"  >Surveys and methods</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;             <a href="hicks4.htm"  >Broad-scale topography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;             <a href="hicks5.htm"  >Braid belt dynamics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;            <a href="hicks6.htm"  >Summary and Conclusions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;            <a href="hicks7.htm"  >References</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 	 </font></font></center></p></font></BODY> </HTML>
