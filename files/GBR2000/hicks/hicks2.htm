The overall bed slope is 0.0048 while the   d<sub>50</sub> of the gravelly bed material is 28 mm (Carson and Griffiths,   1989). The mean flow is 120 m<sup>3</sup>/s, the mean annual flood is 1520 m<sup>3</sup>/s,   the suspended sediment load is 3.1 Mt/yr (D. M. Hicks, unpublished data), and   the bedload is approximately 210,000-250,000 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (Carson and Griffiths,   1987). </font></P><P ALIGN="center"><a name="fig1"></a><img src="FIG1.jpg" width="600" height="402" alt="Figure 1"></P></font> <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Figure   1.</b> View downstream along the study reach of the Waimakariri River at Crossbank.   Photograph taken December 1999 by Andrew Westaway.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The river is confined to a straight,   1500 m wide course by stopbanks, and this width has been further reduced by   belts of willows on either bank so that the area of active, unvegetated riverbed   averages approximately 1000 m in width. Short (100-200 m long) 'stub' groynes   protruding through the willow belts generally maintain the balance between vegetated   and unvegetated riverbed. The study reach riverbed becomes totally inundated   at flows exceeding about 800-1000 m<sup>3</sup>/s.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before stopbank construction, the   riverbed at Crossbank was unconfined and was approximately 4 km wide, with braided   channels passing either side of a large island (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).   Several kilometres downstream from the study reach, the stopbanks converge,   the river progressively narrows to less than 400 m wide, and the channel pattern   changes from braiding to an alternate bar morphology (<a href="#fig3">Figure   3</a>). Naturally, this reach was constructing an alluvial fan. After confinement,   the deposition of gravel has been concentrated into a narrower width and aggradation   has been controlled by aggressive gravel mining. Some 300,000 m<sup>3</sup>/yr are extracted   (Carson and Griffiths, 1987). Bedload transport during floods was studied in   the reach immediately upstream of the study reach by Carson and Griffiths (1989),   while the sedimentation history of the lower Waimakariri channel has been reported   by Griffiths (1979) and by Blakely and Mosley (1987).</font></p><p align="center"><a name="fig2"></a><img src="FIG2.jpg" width="700" height="534"></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Figure   2.</b> Historical changes in the channel patterns of the Waimakariri River.   In 1927, the river at Crossbank (the study reach location, marked with a yellow   dot) was unconfined; by 1982 it was confined by stopbanks.
