Preliminary findings show several   interesting features. </font></P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Typically, we observe   rapidly migrating gravel sheets during floods and freshes. During recessions,   we see the larger gravel sheets 'freezing', often with very rapid development   of 'recession topography' as the falling water surface is draped over the bar   topography and incision of the bar front results. However, smaller gravel sheets   within the braids continue to migrate downstream for several days after a fresh.   At a slower pace during recessions and normal flows, we see the more classical   channel change expected with braiding (bank erosion, channel migration, bar   growth at diffluences). These features are illustrated in the following two   time-lapse video clips. Both are from the downstream-looking video camera. </font></P><P ALIGN="center"><a name="clip1"></a><embed src="waimak1.avi" width="790" height="600" autoplay="no">  </embed></P><P ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Clip   1</b> covers the period 15 June to 25 July 1999. This illustrates the classic   braiding process, with bank erosion feeding bar growth at a diffluence and the   whole channel pattern becoming unstable and avulsing. Note the rapid erosion   of the left bank in the foreground and the concurrent build-up of a bar at the   diffluence with a side channel in the middle distance. This deposition closes   off the side channel, and the whole process increases the sinuosity of the foreground   braid. During the next fresh (on 5 July 1999), this braid avulses to the left.   Note also the often rapidly advancing gravel sheets along the right side of   the foreground braid after 5 July. These continue to migrate well into the flow   recessions.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> (If nothing   or a broken link appears above, please click <a href="waimak1.avi">here</a>   (.avi file, 17.6mb size)</font></P></font><div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <P ALIGN="center"><a name="clip2"></a><embed src="waimak2.avi" width="790" height="600" autoplay="no">  </embed></P><P ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Clip   2</b> covers the period 1 April to 1 May 2000.

While this transport of gravel is intermittent in space and time,   it still contributes to the long-term average flux of bedload. Some previous   assessments of bedload transport in the Waimakariri have assumed no transport   at discharges under 600-800 m<sup>3</sup>/s, based on Shields-type analyses of the critical   tractive shear stress and section-mean hydraulic parameters (Carson and Griffiths,   1987). The videos and field inspection clearly show that the bed material is   mobilised by gravity-assisted river scour of braid banks at much lower discharges   (as also noted by Carson and Griffiths, 1989).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The upshot is that, particularly   in the braid belt where the normal flow tends to concentrate, the river bed   morphology sculpted during flood flows is rapidly altered by braiding processes   and the development of recession topography. Thus even if the braid belt remains   in much the same broad location, the braid-scale topography is very transient.   In contrast, the fresh- and flood-developed morphologies on the broad, low relief   alternate bars have a greater tendency to be preserved due to the rapid emergence   of the bars during recessions and their likely starvation of gravel from upstream   during all but the largest floods.</font></p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <p>   <center>    <font color="#3366FF"> <a href="hicksf.htm"  ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks2.htm"  >Study reach</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks3.htm"  >Surveys     and methods</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks4.htm"  >Broad-scale     topography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks5.htm"  >Braid belt dynamics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks6.htm"  >Summary and Conclusions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks7.htm"  >References</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font>   </center></p></font></font> </BODY> </HTML>
