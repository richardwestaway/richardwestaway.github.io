We conducted   four such surveys between February 1999 and May 2000, capturing the changes   due to an 800 m<sup>3</sup>/s flood in March 1999 and a 970 m<sup>3</sup>/s   flood in April 2000. </font></P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first three surveys used digital photogrammetry to map   the elevation of the dry areas of riverbed. The topography of the beds of the   wetted channels was mapped with the aid of image-analysis techniques. This first   involved fitting digital elevation models (DEMs) to the water surface topography   using water-edge elevations extracted from the photogrammetric analysis. Then,   water depth was classified from colour aerial photographs using empirically   calibrated relationships between water depth and water colour. The wetted bed   elevation was then obtained by subtracting the water depth map from the water   surface map. This approach is detailed by Westaway et al. (<a href="../westaway/westawayf.htm">this   volume</a>).</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth survey used a scanning airborne laser system (ALS)   to survey the dry riverbed topography. This employs an aeroplane-mounted pulsing   laser (1.04 micron wavelength) which scans across the flight path, sampling   the ground elevation at a very high frequency (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).   The study reach was scanned in three overlapping strips, with each strip scanned   three times to increase the spatial density of the data. The location of the   laser system in the air, with respect to the local circuit survey datum, was   found by post-processed differential GPS. The GPS base station was operated   in Christchurch, approximately 20 km distant from the study reach. Seven hundred   check-points were surveyed on the ground and were used to calculate a local   datum adjustment and to evaluate the accuracy of the ground elevation interpolated   from the laser scanning. The standard error of the elevation checks was 16 cm.   Proprietary software was used to filter out laser returns from riparian vegetation.   In all, some 2 million points were scanned at an average horizontal spacing   of 1.6 m. The wetted channel water depths were mapped from aerial photographs   as previously, with water-edge laser measurements used to create elevation maps   of the water surface.</P></font> <p align="center"><a name="fig4"></a><img src="FIG4.jpg" width="583" height="415" alt="Figure 4"></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000"><b>Figure   4</b>. The three fundamental components of an airborne laser system (ALS). First,   the aircraft position is determined by a kinematic dual frequency GPS. Second,   the aircraft's orientation or attitude is continually monitored by a sensitive   Inertial Reference System (IRS). Third, the actual measurement device emits   a laser beam with a high frequency and accurately measures the time taken for   the beam to reflect from objects below it back to the aircraft. The laser beam   is directed in a swathe across the ground by means of a rotating mirror. Post-processing   software combines the scanner's position, the direction in which it is facing,   and the distance measured to compile a digital elevation model (DEM).

To check this visually, we installed   two video cameras 35 m above the riverbed on an electricity pylon. These are   solar powered and video-linked to a computer located 4 km distant, and they   allowed us to capture images of the river bed at 20 minute intervals during   daylight hours. These images are also uploaded to a world-wide-web site at three   hour intervals (<a href="http://www.niwa.cri.nz/cam-era/sites/waimaka/waimakariri-a.htm">http://www.niwa.cri.nz/cam-era/sites/waimaka/waimakariri-a.htm</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analysis of erosion and deposition   patterns between all four surveys is currently in progress. In this paper, we   report on morphological features apparent from the latest, laser-based topographical   mapping, and show a preview of how some of this topography develops using time-lapse   sequences from the video cameras. </font></p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <p>   <center>    <font color="#3366FF"> <a href="hicksf.htm"  ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks2.htm"  >Study reach</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks3.htm"  >Surveys     and methods</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks4.htm"  >Broad-scale     topography</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="hicks5.htm"  >Braid belt dynamics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks6.htm"  >Summary and Conclusions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;     <a href="hicks7.htm"  >References</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font>   </center></p></font></font> </BODY> </HTML>
