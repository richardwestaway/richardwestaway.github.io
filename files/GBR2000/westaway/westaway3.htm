In thisinstance, the study reach was covered using two parallel flyinglines, to allow a scale of 1:5000 to be used. Had a single flyingline been used, imagery scale would have been confined to 1:8000by the riverbed width, leading to a reduction in the besttheoretical precision. Photo-control was provided by a number oftargets, carefully placed on the riverbed before the photographswere taken so that there were at least five targets on eachimage. Their position was determined using a Trimble GPS survey. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DEMs of the Waimakariri studyreach were generated using Imagine OrthoMAX installed on aSilicon Graphics workstation. Given the scale of the aerialphotographs, the scanning resolution used (14  m), and thesubsequent quality of the photogrammetric 'bundle adjustment',the software calculated 0.3 m to 0.4 m as the optimum possibleDEM grid spacing. DEMs were ultimately collected at a gridspacing of 1.0 m to reduce computation time and resources needed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br></font></p><p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>3.2. DEMpost-processing</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the past, DEM post-processingwas a largely manual task, with an operator editing DEM pointswhere there appeared (visually) to be errors. While this approachis still useful and necessary in some situations, it is a veryslow process, with an experienced photogrammetrist able to matchonly 500 points per hour (Lane, 1994). With a large, highresolution DEM (such as the Waimakariri study reach, whichcontains 5 million potential points), it is unfeasible to supposethat a human operator can check every point on the DEM surface.This implies that several phases of post-processing are needed.First, automated methods should be used to 'filter' the raw DEMsand remove errors that fall within certain topographic criteria.Then, if necessary, manual editing can be used in specific areaswhere highly accurate topography is desired, or where there arelikely to be errors in the DEM surface. For the Waimakariri DEMs,an automated post-processing procedure was develope</font><fontface="Arial">d, whereby three categories of points were removed:(i) points that fell in wetted and vegetated areas; (ii) pointswhere automated stereo-matching had been unsuccessful; and (iii)points that fell outside a local topographic deviation criteria.If errors still remain, manual editing is possible within theOrthoMAX Professional module. This allows an operator to add,delete or edit individual points in a DEM surface, or to addbreaklines, based on visualisation of the correspondingstereo-photograph.</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The raw DEM surface for the wholestudy reach in February 1999 is shown in (</font><a href="#fig4"><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">Figure 4a</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">). It is immediately noticeable that thereare several areas where large errors have occurred. These errorstake the form of dark and light areas on </font><a href="#fig4"><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">Figure 4a</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">, and generally correspond to submergedzones, as can be seen in </font><a href="#fig4"><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">Figure 4b</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica"> which is the same surface but with wetareas masked out. This reinforces the need to abandonphotogrammetry for topography submerged by slightly turbid water:photogrammetry alone could clearly not be used to recover thesubmerged topography of the Waimakariri riverbed. Hence, for eachepoch, a wet/dry classified image was generated (</font><ahref="#fig5"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Figure 5</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">), and all elevation fixes made in 'wet'areas were removed. Vegetation also produces errors inphotogrammetrically-derived surfaces (Lane <em>et al</em>.,2000), and needs attention. In this case, however, becausevegetation has a similar spectral signature to water on black andwhite imagery, vegetated areas were classified as 'wet', and werealso eliminated. </font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br></font><a name="fig4"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> <imgsrc="fig4.gif" alt="Figure 4" width="800" height="1080"> </font></p><p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Figure4 </b>DEM surfaces for the whole study reach shown in </font><ahref="#fig3"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial,Helvetica">Figure3</font></a><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial,Helvetica">: (a)the raw DEM surface; (b) the raw DEM surface with wet areasmasked out; and (c) the re-interpolated DEM surface following theremoval of unsuccessful matches, and wet and vegetated points,also with wet areas masked out.

This was achieved byusing a low resolution DEM of the study reach (collected at 5 mgrid spacing) which gave a smoothed but more reliable DEMsurface. Then, where the high resolution (1 m spaced) DEMelevation was greater than +/- 0.5 m from the low resolution DEMsurface, an error was assumed, and the point removed from the DEMsurface.
