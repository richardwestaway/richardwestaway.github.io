Theory</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Photogrammetry is a'line-of-sight' survey method, meaning that it can only be usedto derive an elevation for those objects or landforms visible onthe image. In the same way as shadows or vegetation can hide thetrue topography (e.g. Lane, 1994), turbid water masks thesubmerged bed. For these areas, image analysis is used to derivean empirical relationship between water colour and water depthfrom which depths can be estimated, a method previously usedsuccessfully by Winterbottom and Gilvear (1997) and Gilvear <em>etal</em>. (1998). This study takes this methodology one stepfurther by combining the estimated water depth data with amodelled water surface to give fully three-dimensional topographyfrom inundated areas. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bathymetric mapping of lakes andoceans from aerial photographs has been used quite frequently inthe past. However, rivers are considered optically more complex.In particular, the colour of river water is modified by threefactors not usually of concern in lakes or oceans: (i)particulate matter that rivers maintain in suspension (but whichtends to settle out in lakes and oceans); (ii) the visualpresence of the banks and bed due to the comparatively shallownature of rivers; and (iii) areas of white water, which willchange the optical properties of rivers due to the spectrallynon-selective scattering by air bubbles entrained in rapids andriffles (Davies-Colley <em>et al</em>., 1993).</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On aerial photographs of turbidriver water, colour can be thought of as determined by therelative proportions of light reflected from the submerged bedand from within the water column itself. The range of colours isbounded by zero water depth at one extreme (in which case alllight is reflected from the bed) and the depth at which all lightis reflected from the water column at the other (in which case amaximum predictable depth is reached). Between these two endpoints, the relationship between water colour and water depth maybe determined empirically, giving a relationship of the formwater depth = <em>ln</em>(water colour) (Lyzenga, 1981).</font></p><p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>4.2. Method</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Colour on digital aerialphotography is determined by the relative importance of the red,green and blue (RGB) bands in each pixel. The RGB values ofwetted channels were obtained by classifying the imagery into'wet', 'dry' and 'vegetated' areas (</font><ahref="westaway3.htm#fig5"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Figure 5</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">) and then taking the (x,y) position andRGB values those pixels that fell in a wetted channel. The RGBvalues were then transformed using a natural logarithmictransformation to permit a linear relationship between watercolour and water depth (Lyzenga, 1981). The transformed RGBvalues were then used as the independent variables inmultivariate analysis relating water colour to water depth. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To calibrate and validate themodels, water depth data sets were concurrent with thephotography, using National Institute of Water and AtmosphericResearch (NIWA) and Environment Canterbury (EC) field teams(Hicks <em>et al</em>., 1999). The ground survey of wettedchannels involved both total station and roving GPS survey, andprovided information on water depth for a large proportion of thestudy reach. The total station survey was continuous, allowingaround 1200 points to be collected each day. The GPS survey useda Trimble RTK system which gave real-time depths to an accuracyof a few centimetres. This was mounted on a quad bike for waterdepths of up to about 0.6 m, and 'hand-held' for water depths upto 1.0 m. In deeper, navigable channels, initially a jet boat andlater a wooden kayak fitted with GPS and an echo-sounder provideda large number of water depth measurements. The data for eachepoch was divided into two equal sets to act as calibration andindependent check data-sets respectively. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The aerial photographs of thestudy reach were geo-referenced using the photo-control pointsestablished for the photogrammetric survey. The imagery wasrectified rather than ortho-rectified because the DEMs weregenerated using black and white and high-resolution scans, yetcolour imagery was required for the empirical colour-depthrelationship. This was justified by the low vertical relief ofthe riverbed, which reduces the need for vertical imagedisplacement to be considered. For example, given the scale andsize of the aerial photographs used, a feature 1 m high would bedisplaced laterally by less than one pixel (1 m), even if it wereon the extreme edge of the image. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Water depths were assigned tospecific pixels using a simple automated matching routine. Thistook each surveyed water depth in turn, and calculated theaverage RGB values of all pixels that fell within a specifiedmaximum search radius. The maximum search radius was set to 0.5 m(the object space pixel size) as this gives a search diameterequal to the best (x,y) accuracy that can be expected from theimagery. </font></p><p><font size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>4.3. Results</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The quality of depth predictionswas assessed using mean error (ME) and standard deviation oferror (SDE) as compared with the independent 'check' data-set (</font><ahref="#tab1"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Table 1</font></a><fontface="Arial,Helvetica">).</font></p><p align="center"><a name="tab1"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Table1: </b>The results of the multivariate analyses between watercolour and water depth for each epoch.</font></p><div align="center"><center><table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">    <tr>        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>Epoch</strong></font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>'Best'        predictors</strong></font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>Number of        tested points</strong></font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>ME (cm)</strong></font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>SDE (cm)</strong></font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>R  (%)</strong></font></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><font face="Arial">Feb 1999</font></td>        <td align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">R</font><font        color="#0000FF" face="Arial">B</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">12996</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">-1.5</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">19.9</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">48</font></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><font face="Arial">March 1999</font></td>        <td align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">R</font><font        color="#0000FF" face="Arial">B</font></td>        <td align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Arial">1025</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">-0.8</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">19.2</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">61</font></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td><font face="Arial">Feb 2000</font></td>        <td align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">R</font><font        color="#00FF00" face="Arial">G</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">14303</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">+0.2</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">16.8</font></td>        <td align="center"><font face="Arial">57</font></td>    </tr></table></center></div><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite the relatively low R values (around half of the variance in water depth is explained),the standard deviation of errors (SDE) are quite encouraginggiven the range of water depths (0 to about 2 m).
